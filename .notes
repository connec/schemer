The application should be 'human readable' from the ground up, meaning all
languages used should be recent ones at the forefront of elegant language design
e.g.:
  CoffeeScript
  Jade
  Stylus

However, particularly with the above languages (all implemented for CommonJS),
compilation is an issue.  E.g., during debugging, everything should rebuild
every time the browser is refreshed, whilst in production everything should be
precompiled.

The browser needs to load a page, meaning the layout must be compiled server-
side if it's written in Jade etc.
