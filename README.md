# Schemer

Schemer is a lighweight database management web application.

## Usage

### NPM

Schemer is available on npm: `npm install -g schemer`.  You can then start the app (port 3000) with
`schemer`.

### Source

Alternately, `git clone` this repo to where you want and run `node bin/schemer`.

A more useful 'bin' script is coming soon (tm).

## Development

If you want to play around with the source code you can use `coffee watch.coffee` to monitor
(non-dependency) code for changes and rebuild/reload client/server files as appropriate.
