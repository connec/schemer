# Schemer

Schemer is a lighweight database management web application.

## Installation

### NPM

Schemer is available on npm: `npm install -g schemer`.  You can then start the app with `schemer`.

### Source

Alternately, `git clone` this repo to where you want and run `node bin/schemer`.

A more useful 'bin' script is coming soon (tm).

## Usage

Once you've started the app, visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and log in to a
MySQL server.

## Development

If you want to play around with the source code you can use `coffee watch.coffee` to monitor
(non-dependency) code for changes and rebuild/reload client/server files as appropriate.
